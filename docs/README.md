# Simple Dependency Injection
### Copyright 2017 - Gateway Programming School, Inc.

## What is it?
SimpleDI.Configuration is a custom configuration provider for SimpleDI, a new dependency injection system that is highly extensible.  Using SimpleDI.Configuration, you can easily use the app.config or web.config file of your project to define your dependency injection.

## Where do I get it?
[Nuget.org]( https://www.nuget.org/packages/GPS.SimpleDI.Configuration/)

## How to use it...
Using the default injector and loader couldn't be easier.  Simply define your XML for you configured object and call the SimpleDiFactory to instantiate your object.
